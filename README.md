#  Configuration

## My inspiration for i3 

For my configuration a friend advised me this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) channel which is that of a person who uses vim and i3-gaps his [dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) are available on his profile [Github](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz). And i watch this [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbJK6r2Xwo) to understand operation system.
And i advise you to see the channel [Unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) on Reddit, lots of people use i3-gaps and share their dotfiles of configuration.
